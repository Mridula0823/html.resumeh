    <LI><I>NATURE ENTHUSIAST</I></LI>
    <P>Engaging with nature has taught me
        valuable lessons in patience, resilience,
        and mindfulness, which I apply to every
        aspect of my life. It reminds me of the
        interconnectedness of all living
        things and instills in me a profound
        sense of gratitude for the beauty
        and abundance of our planet.</P>
        <LI><I>PLANE SPOTTING</I></LI>
        <P>As a passionate plane spotter, I enjoy
            observing and documenting various
            aircraft as they take off, land, and
            taxi at airports. With a keen eye for detail,
            <I>I find joy </I>in identifying different aircraft
            models, airlines, and livery designs.</P>
